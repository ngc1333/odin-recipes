    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are foods that just work amazingly well with each other, and the combo of blueberry and cornmeal is a great example. 
        That goes for both the flavor and texture, as the soft, sweet nuggets of blueberry are a perfect partner for the gritty goodness of the ground corn.</p>
    <p>Specific ingredients aside, every few years I like to demo the invaluable galette technique, just to make sure everyone knows about this extremely versatile pastry.
        Not only can you use all kinds of fresh fruit, but this freestyle tart will work for savory fillings as well. 
        In fact, before I found those gorgeous blueberries, I was mulling over a chicken pot pie-inspired version. One day.</p>
    <p>If you're new to baking, you'll be happy to know that this is what we call in the business a "rustic" pastry, which means you don't have to stress about making it look perfect. 
        If you want to do a little fine-tuning, like I did, feel free, but no one is going to have a problem if you don't. 
        Now, running out of ice cream is another story, so make sure you're stocked. Anyway, whether it's nice and neat, or extra rustic, 
        I really do hope you give this a try soon. </p>
    <h3 class="subheading">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>For the Cornmeal Crust
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  </li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornmeal  </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt  </li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed  </li>
        <li>6 tablespoons ice water, or as needed  </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>For the Blueberry Filling
        <li>1 pound fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried </li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice  </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest   </li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch   </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>For Egg and Sugar Glaze
        <li>1 large egg, beaten </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon demerara sugar  </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subheading">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl with a pastry blender. Add cold butter and combine with the pastry 
            blender until coarse crumbs form. Drizzle in cold water, a little at a time, stirring to combine with a fork, until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a work surface and bring together with your hands; press into a disk of dough.</li>
        <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a SilpatÂ® baking mat.</li>
        <li>Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured work surface into a 15-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place blueberry filling into the center of the dough, leaving 3 to 4 inches of space around the border of dough. Fold dough up and around the berries, 
            rotating a few inches and make another fold, overlapping the first; repeat around the dough until pleats are formed.</li>
        <li>Combine beaten egg and water in a small bowl and brush on the dough. Sprinkle on demerara sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
