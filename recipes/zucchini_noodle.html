    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed </li>
        <li>5 zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler </li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced garlic </li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) container Greek yogurt </li>
        <li>1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Working in batches, saute enough zucchini to fit in the skillet with 1 
            teaspoon garlic until zucchini is slightly browned and softened, 3 to 6 minutes. 
            Repeat with remaining olive oil, zucchini, and garlic. Transfer cooked zucchini mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk marinara sauce, yogurt, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a saucepan over low heat; 
            cook and stir until sauce is warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sauce over zucchini mixture in the baking dish. 
            Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and a pinch of Italian seasoning over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
